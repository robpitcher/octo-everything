## 🧠 Product Brain: The Demo Concept

**Product Brain** represents a structured repository approach that demonstrates the GitHub SDLC workflow end-to-end. It shows how all team members—PMs, developers, QA, security, and release managers—can collaborate using GitHub + Copilot.

### What Product Brain Demonstrates

| Capability | How It's Shown | Personas |
|------------|----------------|----------|
| **Knowledge Management** | Specs, insights, research organized in folders | PM, Tech Writer |
| **Copilot Spaces** | Curated context collections that ground AI responses | All roles |
| **Agentic Workflows** | Custom agents for exploration, analysis, prototyping | PM, Developer |
| **AI-Assisted Development** | Copilot generates code, tests, docs, issues | Developer, QA |
| **CI/CD Integration** | Actions workflows for test, build, deploy | DevOps, Release |
| **Security Scanning** | Dependabot, secret scanning, CodeQL | Security |
| **Unified Platform** | Everything in one repo—replaces 4+ Atlassian tools | All roles |

### Repository Structure
```
product-brain/
├── specs/           # PRDs, feature specs
├── insights/        # Synthesized research findings
├── research/        # Market analysis, customer data
├── roadmap/         # OKRs, priorities, timelines
├── analysis/        # Analysis scripts, DAX queries for Power BI
└── prototypes/      # Working demos, proof-of-concepts
```

### Why This Matters for the Demo
| Atlassian Stack (4+ tools) | GitHub Platform (1 tool) |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|
| Jira + Confluence + Bitbucket + Jenkins | GitHub (Issues, Projects, Repos, Actions) |
| Context scattered across tools | All context in one place |
| Manual sync between systems | Auto-linked PRs ↔ Issues ↔ Projects |
| AI doesn't understand code (Rovo) | AI understands your codebase (Copilot) |
| Separate logins, contracts, support | One platform, one contract, one support |
| Developers context-switch constantly | Developers stay in VS Code / GitHub |

---

## 📈 The Evolution of Development Tools

> "AI agents are a much better product manager than I ever was" — Dennis Yang, Principal PM at Chime

| Era | Development Approach | Tools | GitHub Equivalent |
|-----|----------------------|-------|-------------------|
| **2010s** | Manual everything | Jira, Confluence, Jenkins, Bitbucket | ❌ Legacy fragmentation |
| **2020s** | Integrated platforms | Atlassian Cloud, Azure DevOps | ⚠️ Better, still siloed |
| **2025+** | AI-native SDLC | GitHub + Copilot as unified platform | ✅ **This Demo** |

The key shift: Every role moves from *manual, tool-hopping workflows* to *AI-assisted, unified platform workflows*.

---

## 🤖 Agent Customization

Configure AI agents to understand your product context:

### Workspace Instructions
Always-on context about company, conventions, personas.

**File:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
```markdown
# Product Context
- Company: Contoso Outdoor Gear
- Target users: Outdoor enthusiasts, sustainability-conscious consumers
- Tech stack: React Native, Node.js, PostgreSQL
- Personas: Trail Seeker (casual), Peak Performer (serious), Eco-Advocate (values-driven)
```

### File-Specific Instructions
Auto-attach context when editing specific file patterns.

```yaml
applyTo: "specs/**"
instructions: |
  When editing specs, always include:
  - User persona affected
  - Success metrics
  - Dependencies on other specs
```

### Reusable Prompts
Slash commands for common workflows:

| Command | Purpose | Output |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `/feedback-synthesis` | Raw feedback → themed insights | Structured analysis with quotes |
| `/spec-explainer` | PRD → stakeholder summary | Executive-friendly 1-pager |
| `/meeting-prep` | Gather context, surface questions | Briefing doc with open items |
| `/issue-from-insight` | Insight → GitHub Issue | Issue with labels & context |

### Custom Agents
Specialized personas configured via Copilot instructions:

> **Note:** These agents are configured using `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and custom prompts. "Permissions" represent intended usage patterns enforced through prompt engineering, not hard access controls.

| Agent | Purpose | Intended Scope |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| **Explore** | Query product knowledge | Read-only queries |
| **Data Analyst** | Create analysis scripts, DAX queries | Analysis in `analysis/` |
| **Scaffold** | Build HTML/Tailwind prototypes | Prototypes in `prototypes/` |
| **Design Partner** | Devil's advocate, challenge thinking | Socratic questioning mode |

#### Incident Response Comparison

| Phase | Atlassian (Jira + Opsgenie) | GitHub |
|-------|----------------------------|--------|
| **Alert** | Opsgenie pages on-call | Actions → Webhook → PagerDuty |
| **Triage** | Create Jira incident ticket | Create Issue with incident template |
| **Investigate** | Open multiple tools, search Confluence | Ask Copilot: "What changed in the last 24 hours?" |
| **Communicate** | Update Jira + Slack manually | Issue comments + Slack integration |
| **Resolve** | Push fix via Jenkins | Push fix, Actions deploys |
| **Postmortem** | Create Confluence page manually | Copilot generates from incident timeline |
| **Action items** | Create Jira tickets manually | Copilot creates Issues from postmortem |

#### DevOps Demo Script

```
SRE: "Let me show you our incident workflow..."

[Simulate incident alert]

SRE: "Alert comes in. I create an issue using our incident template."

[Create issue from template]

SRE: "Now I need to understand what changed. Copilot..."

COPILOT: "In the last 24 hours:
         - 3 PRs merged to main
         - 1 deployment to production at 14:32
         - Config change in deploy workflow at 14:30
         
         The config change modified timeout settings.
         This correlates with the error spike."

SRE: "Found it. Let me revert..."

[Create revert PR]

SRE: "Actions runs tests, deploys automatically. Now postmortem..."

[Ask Copilot to generate postmortem]

COPILOT: "I've drafted a postmortem in incidents/2026-02-16-timeout.md:
         - Timeline reconstructed from commits and deploys
         - Root cause: timeout reduced below p99 latency
         - Action items: Add latency check to CI pipeline"
```

## 📊 Leadership & Executive Workflows

> **Key Insight:** Leadership doesn't care about tools—they care about outcomes. GitHub provides the data pipeline; Power BI provides the executive dashboard.

### What Leadership Asks

| Question | Atlassian Answer | GitHub + Power BI Answer |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------|
| "Are we on track for Q2?" | Export Jira → Excel → Build chart | Projects Insights → Shareable link |
| "Why is Feature X late?" | Dig through Jira, ask PM | Copilot: "Summarize blockers for Feature X" |
| "How productive is the team?" | Guess from velocity | DORA metrics dashboard (deploy frequency, lead time) |
| "What's our security posture?" | Ask Security team | Security Overview dashboard (native) |
| "How much technical debt?" | No visibility | Dependabot + Code Scanning trends |

### GitHub Native Metrics for Leadership

| Metric | Where to Find | What It Tells You |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| **Deployment Frequency** | Actions → Workflow runs | How often we ship (DORA) |
| **Lead Time for Changes** | PR open → deploy timestamp (calculate via API) | Speed from code to production (DORA) |
| **Change Failure Rate** | Rollback deploys / Total deploys (calculate via API) | Quality of releases (DORA) |
| **Mean Time to Recovery** | Incident issue open → resolved (calculate via API) | Resilience (DORA) |
| **Sprint Progress** | Projects → Insights → Historical chart | Items completed over time (burn-up style) |
| **Story Point Totals** | Projects → Insights → Aggregation | Sprint capacity, completion |
| **Open Security Alerts** | Security → Overview | Risk exposure |
| **Dependency Health** | Dependabot → Alerts | Supply chain risk |

> **Note:** DORA metrics require custom calculation via GitHub API or third-party tools. GitHub does not provide native DORA dashboards.

### Leadership Demo Script

```
EXEC: "I need to update the board on engineering health. What do you have?"

[Open Power BI Dashboard]

ALEX: "Here's our engineering health dashboard—data pulled directly from GitHub.

       DORA Metrics (top left):
       - We deploy 12 times per week (up from 8 last quarter)
       - Lead time is 2.3 days (industry elite is <1 day, we're close)
       - Change failure rate is 4% (below 15% threshold)
       - MTTR is 1.2 hours (excellent)
       
       This tells you: the team is shipping fast AND safely."

[Point to Portfolio View]

ALEX: "Portfolio status:
       - Checkout Redesign: 90% complete, ships next week
       - Search Rewrite: 45% complete, ON TRACK
       - Mobile Refresh: 20% complete, AT RISK (see the red indicator)
       
       The at-risk flag is automatic—Copilot detected 3 blockers
       older than 5 days."

[Point to Security Posture]

ALEX: "Security:
       - 2 critical vulnerabilities (both have PRs in review)
       - Trend is down 15% from last month
       - No secrets exposed (push protection working)"

EXEC: "Can I see this without logging into GitHub?"

[Generate shareable link]

ALEX: "This Power BI dashboard updates hourly. You can access it from
       your browser, Teams, or the Power BI mobile app.
       
       With Atlassian, you'd need Jira Align ($15k+ annually) plus
       manual exports to get this view."
```

### ROI Metrics for Leadership

| ROI Category | Metric | How to Calculate | Target |
|--------------|--------|------------------|--------|
| **Developer Productivity** | PR cycle time reduction | (Old avg - New avg) / Old avg | 30% reduction |
| **Time to Market** | Lead time for changes | Commit → Production deploy | <1 week |
| **Quality** | Change failure rate | Failed deploys / Total deploys | <15% |
| **Security** | Mean time to remediate | Vuln detected → Fixed | <7 days |
| **Cost Savings** | Tool consolidation | Atlassian cost - GitHub cost | 18-72% savings |
| **Context Switching** | Tools used per task | Survey / observation | <2 tools |

---

## �🔍 Act 0: Explore the Knowledge

### Scene Setup
Before writing anything, Alex explores what the Product Brain repo already knows — using **Copilot Spaces** to organize and query curated context.

### What is Copilot Spaces?
Copilot Spaces let you organize context that grounds Copilot's responses:
- **Include:** Repositories, code, PRs, issues, notes, images, file uploads
- **Share:** With team members or publicly
- **Stay in sync:** Sources auto-update as they change
- **Use anywhere:** Copilot Chat on GitHub or via MCP server in VS Code

### The Agentic Pattern
```
🔍 Explore → 📊 Analyze → ⚡ Prototype → 🤔 Challenge
```

This is the core workflow that Product Brain demonstrates: ~15 minutes from question to working prototype, zero meetings, full context with citations.

### Demo Script
```
ALEX: "Before I write a new spec, let me check our Product Brain space..."

[Open Copilot Spaces → Select "Product Brain" space]

ALEX: "This space includes our specs folder, customer research, and recent PRs.
       Let me ask: What do we know about customer sustainability preferences?"

[Copilot searches across the curated context in the Space]

COPILOT: "Based on your Product Brain space, I found relevant context in 4 sources:
         → specs/sustainability-dashboard.md — Approved spec with Impact Dashboard
         → insights/sustainability-survey-2025.md — 68% say sustainability influences purchases
         → research/gen-z-outdoor-trends.md — Gen Z expects eco transparency
         → specs/loyalty-program-v2.md — Sustainability perks in Trail Rewards"

ALEX: "Perfect—we already have research. I don't need to start from scratch.
       And this space is shared with my team, so they can explore the same context."
```

### What This Replaces
| Confluence Today | GitHub + Copilot Spaces |
|------------------|-------------------------|
| Search across spaces (often misses things) | Curated context with semantic search |
| Manual linking between pages | Cross-references maintained automatically |
| Context lost when people leave | Shared Spaces persist beyond chat history |
| Repeated questions to teammates | Self-service knowledge via shared Spaces |

---

## 🎬 Act 1: The Idea (PRD Creation)

### Scene Setup
Alex has a new feature idea: **"Dark Mode for Mobile App"**

### What to Demo

| Confluence Feature | GitHub Equivalent | Demo Action |
|--------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Create new page | Create markdown doc | File → New → From PRD template |
| Rich text editing | Markdown + preview | Write requirements with headers, lists |
| Embed images/diagrams | Drag-drop images, Mermaid | Add architecture diagram |
| @mention stakeholders | @username | Tag engineering lead for review |
| Real-time collaboration | VS Code Live Share* | Second person edits simultaneously |
| Comments | Inline comments | Add review comment, resolve it |
| Version history | Git history | Show previous versions |

*Requires VS Code Live Share extension; alternatively, use PR-based async collaboration.

### Demo Script
```
ALEX: "I start my day in VS Code—this is my single interface for everything.
       Let me create a new PRD from our template..."
       
[Create markdown doc from template]

ALEX: "I'll write up the requirements. Notice I can add diagrams right inline—
       this is Mermaid syntax, renders automatically."
       
[Add Mermaid diagram]

ALEX: "Now I'll tag Sarah to review. She can edit at the same time I do—
       no more 'page is locked' messages like Confluence."
       
[@mention, show real-time cursor]

ALEX: "And here's something Confluence can't do—watch this..."
```

### The Differentiator
```
ALEX: "Copilot, summarize the key technical risks in this PRD."

[Copilot analyzes and responds]

ALEX: "Atlassian's Rovo can't do this—it doesn't understand code context.
       Copilot knows our codebase, so it can flag that OAuth implementation 
       will conflict with our existing auth module."
```

---

## 📊 Act 1.5: Analyze Data & Create Visualizations

### Scene Setup
The Explore agent found a customer survey. Alex digs deeper into the raw data and needs to create visualizations for leadership.

### GitHub Projects Built-in Analytics

Before reaching for Power BI, GitHub Projects provides native analytics capabilities:

| Capability | What It Does | When to Use |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Insights Charts** | Bar, column, stacked charts from project data | Quick team metrics, sprint reports |
| **Historical Charts** | Burn up charts showing Open → Completed over time | Sprint progress, velocity trends |
| **Aggregations** | Sum, average, min, max on number fields | Story point totals, estimate accuracy |
| **Roadmap View** | Timeline visualization with drag-to-adjust dates | Release planning, milestone tracking |

**GitHub Projects Insights supports:**
- **Current Charts**: Visualize items by status, assignee, label, iteration, or any custom field
- **Historical Charts**: Track progress over time with "Burn up" style charts (Open, Completed, Not Planned states)
- **Aggregations**: Y-axis can show count, sum, average, minimum, or maximum of number fields (like Story Points)
- **Filters**: Slice data by any field combination
- **Chart Types**: Bar charts, stacked column charts, line charts for historical data

> **Note:** GitHub Projects native charts do NOT include traditional Gantt charts with dependency lines. The Roadmap view provides timeline visualization but not dependency management. For Gantt-style views with dependencies, use Power BI.

### Layering Power BI on GitHub

For advanced analytics beyond built-in Insights, Power BI integrates with GitHub through multiple methods:

#### Integration Options

| Method | Data Available | Best For |
|--------|----------------|----------|
| **GitHub (Beta) Connector** | Issues, PRs, commits, contributors, repos | Repository metrics, team performance |
| **Web/REST API Connector** | Any GitHub REST API endpoint | Custom data extraction |
| **GraphQL API + Python** | Projects, custom fields, roadmaps, all data | Full project analytics, Gantt charts |
| **CSV Export → Power BI** | Exported project data | One-time reports, offline analysis |

#### Power BI GitHub Connector (Built-in)

Power BI includes a native **GitHub (Beta) connector** that provides direct access to:
- Repository metadata
- Issues and pull requests
- Commits and contributors
- Organization data

```
Power BI Desktop → Get Data → GitHub (Beta) → Authenticate → Select tables
```

#### GitHub Projects Data via GraphQL

For GitHub Projects data (which includes custom fields, iterations, roadmaps), use the GraphQL API:

```graphql
query ProjectItems($org: String!, $number: Int!) {
  organization(login: $org) {
    projectV2(number: $number) {
      items(first: 100) {
        nodes {
          fieldValues(first: 20) {
            nodes {
              ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldTextValue { text field { ... on ProjectV2Field { name } } }
              ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldNumberValue { number field { ... on ProjectV2Field { name } } }
              ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldDateValue { date field { ... on ProjectV2Field { name } } }
              ... on ProjectV2ItemFieldIterationValue { title startDate duration }
            }
          }
          content { ... on Issue { title state createdAt closedAt } }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Visualization Types in Power BI

| Visualization | GitHub Data Source | Use Case |
|---------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Gantt Chart** | Projects + Start/End dates | Release timelines with dependencies |
| **Burndown** | Issues closed over time | Sprint progress tracking |
| **Velocity Chart** | Story points per iteration | Sprint capacity planning |
| **Contributor Graph** | Commits by author | Team workload distribution |
| **PR Cycle Time** | PR created → merged timestamps | Development efficiency |
| **Issue Flow** | Issue state transitions | Bottleneck identification |

### Demo Script
```
ALEX: "The survey insight is interesting, but I want to understand the segments
       and create a leadership dashboard..."

[Select Data Analyst agent]

ALEX: "Analyze research/data/customer-survey-2025.csv — what predicts 
       sustainability interest? Also generate DAX measures for our Power BI dashboard."

[Agent generates Python analysis + DAX queries]

COPILOT: "I've created analysis/scripts/sustainability-analysis.py with:
         📈 Python script analyzing the CSV data
         📊 DAX measures for Power BI: 
            - Age×Sustainability cross-tab
            - Tenure correlation
            - Segment breakdown visual
         🎯 Key finding: 'Eco-Advocates' segment — high NPS, 2.3x LTV, 31% of base
         
         For the Power BI dashboard, I've created:
         - analysis/powerbi/sustainability-measures.dax
         - analysis/powerbi/segment-breakdown.json (visual config)"

ALEX: "Now let's create a Gantt chart for the Dark Mode release timeline..."

[Switch to Projects data]

ALEX: "Copilot, create a Power BI Gantt chart from our GitHub Project, 
       showing iterations, start dates, and dependencies."

COPILOT: "I've created analysis/powerbi/release-gantt.py that:
         1. Queries GitHub GraphQL API for Project items
         2. Extracts Start Date, Target Date, and Iteration fields
         3. Outputs JSON for Power BI import
         
         The Gantt visual will show:
         - Dark bars for each issue/task
         - Iteration groupings
         - Milestone markers from your Project
         
         Run the script and import release-data.json into Power BI Desktop."
```

## 🎬 Act 2: The Breakdown (PRD → Issues)

### Scene Setup
PRD is approved. Alex needs to create work items for the team.

### What to Demo

| Jira Feature | GitHub Equivalent | Demo Action |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Create epic | Create Issue with "Epic" label | New Issue → Epic template |
| Create stories | Create linked Issues | Child issues |
| Create sub-tasks | Tasklists | Add checklist to story |
| Estimate points | Custom field (Number) | Set Story Points = 5 |
| Set priority | Custom field (Single select) | Set Priority = P1 |
| Assign to sprint | Add to Iteration | Assign to "Sprint 23" |

### Demo Script (The Manual Way)
```
ALEX: "Traditionally, I'd manually create each issue from my PRD—
       that takes about an hour for a feature this size."
       
[Create one epic, one story manually to show it works]
```

### Demo Script (The AI Way)
```
ALEX: "But here's where GitHub changes the game. Watch this..."

[Select PRD requirements section]

ALEX: "Copilot, create GitHub Issues for each requirement in this PRD.
       Use our standard epic/story structure."

[Copilot drafts 8-10 issues for review]

ALEX: "In 30 seconds, I have my entire backlog drafted. Let me review 
       before creating them...
       - Epic: Dark Mode Implementation
       - Story: Update color tokens
       - Story: Add system preference detection
       - Story: Create settings toggle
       
       I'll confirm each one, then Copilot creates them with links back to the PRD."

[Create issues after review, show issues linked back to PRD in repo]
```

> **Demo Note:** Copilot generates issue drafts that require human review and confirmation before creation. This ensures quality and allows PMs to refine acceptance criteria.

### The Differentiator
```
ALEX: "Now here's what Atlassian absolutely cannot do..."

ALEX: "Copilot, based on our team's Git history, who should own each story?"

[Copilot suggests assignments based on code ownership]

ALEX: "It knows Sarah owns the design system, so she gets the color tokens.
       It knows Marcus built the settings page, so he gets the toggle.
       Rovo can't do this—it doesn't have code context."
```

## ⚡ Act 2.5: Build the Prototype

### Scene Setup
Before sprint planning, Alex wants to validate the concept with a working prototype.

### The Agentic Pattern
```

```

### Demo Script
```
ALEX: "Normally I'd wait 2 sprints for engineering to build something.
       But I can validate the concept right now..."

[Select Scaffold agent]

ALEX: "Build a Dark Mode prototype based on specs/dark-mode.md"

[Agent generates HTML/Tailwind/Alpine.js prototype]

COPILOT: "I've created prototypes/dark-mode/index.html with:
         • System preference detection
         • Manual toggle with smooth transition
         • Color token preview across components
         • Accessibility contrast checker"

[Open prototype in browser]

ALEX: "In 2 minutes, I have a working demo I can show stakeholders.
       Let me share this in our spec review..."

[Copy prototype URL to spec discussion]
```

### What This Replaces
| Today | Product Brain on GitHub |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Write spec, hope people understand it | Show working prototype |
| Wait for engineering bandwidth | PM builds proof-of-concept |
| Stakeholders imagine the feature | Stakeholders interact with demo |
| 2-4 week feedback cycle | Same-day validation |

## 🤔 Act 2.75: Challenge the Thinking

### Scene Setup
Before committing to sprint scope, Alex stress-tests the approach.

### Demo Script
```
ALEX: "I want to find the blind spots before the exec review..."

[Select Design Partner agent]

ALEX: "What's the strongest argument against specs/dark-mode.md?"
```

### Agent Response Patterns

**Devil's Advocate Mode:**
```
COPILOT: "Dark mode increases testing surface by 2x. Have you budgeted for:
         - Visual regression testing for both themes?
         - Accessibility audits for both color schemes?
         - User research on actual preference distribution?"
```

**Socratic Mode:**
```
COPILOT: "What would need to be true for users to actually switch to dark mode?
         Your spec assumes 'users want it' — have you validated that assumption
         beyond the 2023 survey which had 12% response rate?"
```

**Blind Spot Hunter:**
```
COPILOT: "Who loses if this succeeds? 
         - Marketing just launched light-mode brand guidelines
         - The new onboarding flow assumes light theme
         - Partner integrations may not support dark themes
         Have you aligned with these stakeholders?"
```

### Demo Script (Continued)
```
ALEX: "Hmm, good points. Let me add these risks to the spec..."

[Add 'Open Questions' section to spec]

ALEX: "Now when leadership asks 'what could go wrong?', I'm prepared.
       Better to find these now than in the post-mortem."
```

### What This Replaces
| Today | Product Brain on GitHub |
|-------|-------------------------|
| Hope reviewers catch issues | Proactively surface blind spots |
| Defensiveness in reviews | Objections already addressed |
| Groupthink in planning | AI provides external perspective |
| Risks discovered in production | Risks discovered before coding |

## 🎯 Feature Parity Scorecard

Use this during/after the demo to validate coverage:

> **⚠️ Accuracy Notes:**
> - **GitHub Projects Insights** provides bar/column charts and historical (burn-up) charts, not traditional burndown or velocity charts. Calculate velocity from story point aggregations.
> - **Dependencies** are tracked via issue links (tracks/tracked-by) but are NOT visualized as arrows or lines in the Roadmap view. Jira Premium provides visual dependency graphs.
> - **Copilot Spaces** may require Copilot Enterprise or be in preview. Verify availability before demoing.

│   ├── dark-mode.md               # Feature spec for demo
│   └── templates/
│       └── prd-template.md        # PRD template
├── insights/
│   └── customer-preferences.md    # Synthesized research
├── research/
│   └── data/
│       └── customer-survey.csv    # Raw data for analysis
├── roadmap/
│   └── q2-priorities.md           # OKRs and priorities
├── analysis/
│   └── scripts/                   # Analysis scripts & DAX (created during demo)
└── prototypes/
    └── dark-mode/                 # Prototype (created during demo)
```

## ⚠️ Cautions & Governance

> *"Vibe coding your way to a production codebase is clearly risky."* — Simon Willison

### What to Watch Out For

#### 1. "Almost Right" is Risky
AI-generated code and analysis needs human review. The 90% that looks correct makes the 10% that's wrong harder to spot.

**Demo Mitigation:** 
- Always show the review step
- "I generated this, now let me verify..."
- Emphasize AI as accelerator, not replacement

#### 2. Tool Adoption ≠ Impact
Measure outcomes (conversion, customer satisfaction) not activity (prompts run, prototypes built). Easy to confuse motion with progress.

**Demo Mitigation:**
- Tie everything back to business metrics
- "This prototype let us validate before building"
- "We shipped 2 weeks faster because of early feedback"

#### 3. Role Clarity Matters
When PMs ship prototypes, who owns quality? When AI drafts specs, who validates claims? Define governance before scaling.

**Questions to Address:**
| New Capability | Governance Question |
|----------------|---------------------|
| PM-built prototypes | Who reviews for security? |
| AI-generated issues | Who validates acceptance criteria? |
| Auto-assigned work | Who handles edge cases? |
| Agent-written analysis | Who checks statistical validity? |

**Demo Mitigation:**
- Show the human-in-the-loop at each step
- "I review every generated issue before committing"
- "The prototype is for validation only, not production"

### Recommended Guardrails

| Guardrail | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Prototype isolation | `prototypes/` folder has `.gitignore` for sensitive data |
| Review required | Branch protection on `specs/` and `roadmap/` |
| Agent permissions | Explore agent is read-only by design |
| Audit trail | All changes committed with linked context |
| Human approval | Actions require approval for production deployment |
