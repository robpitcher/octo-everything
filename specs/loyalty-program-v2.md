# Loyalty Program v2 PRD

- **Status:** In Review
- **Author:** Marcus Webb, Product Manager
- **Last Updated:** January 18, 2026
- **Stakeholders:** Marketing, Engineering, Customer Success, Finance
- **Description:** Revamp the rewards program with sustainability incentives and improved redemption

---

## Problem Statement

Our current points-based loyalty program (Contoso Rewards) has underwhelming engagement:

- **12% redemption rate** (industry benchmark: 25-30%)
- Only 8% of members reach the 500-point threshold for first reward
- NPS for loyalty program: +12 (vs. +45 for overall brand)
- Customer feedback: "confusing," "doesn't feel rewarding" (see [Q4 Feedback](/insights/customer-feedback-q4.md))

## Proposed Solution: Trail Rewards

Replace points accumulation with a **tiered experiential program** that rewards engagement, not just spend.

### Tier Structure

| Tier | Qualification | Key Benefits |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Explorer** | Free signup | 5% back on first purchase, birthday reward, early sale access |
| **Trailblazer** | $500/year spend OR 3 purchases | 10% back, free shipping, gear rental discounts, member events |
| **Summit** | $1,500/year spend | 15% back, exclusive product drops, concierge service, trail cleanup events |

### Experiential Benefits

- **Gear Try-Before-Buy:** Summit members can rent new gear for 2 weeks before purchase
- **Adventure Perks:** Partnerships with Summit Co-op Experiences, AllTrails Pro, national park passes
- **Sustainability Program:** Donate old gear for bonus rewards, carbon offset matching

### Earning Mechanics

- 1 Trail Point per $1 spent
- Bonus points for reviews (50), referrals (200), app purchases (2x)
- Points never expire for active members (1 purchase/year)

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Redemption rate | 12% | 30% | 6 months post-launch |
| Active member rate | 23% | 50% | 12 months |
| Member revenue share | 34% | 55% | 12 months |
| Program NPS | +12 | +40 | 6 months |

## Migration Strategy

- All existing members auto-migrate to Explorer tier
- Current points convert at 100:1 ratio to Trail Points
- 60-day bonus period: 2x points on all purchases
- Personalized emails explaining new benefits

## Open Questions

1. **Partner economics:** Final terms with AllTrails and park pass programs?
2. **Summit concierge:** In-house or outsource? Staffing model?
3. **Fraud prevention:** How to prevent referral abuse?

## Timeline

- Beta launch: Q2 2026 (see [H1 Roadmap](/roadmap/2026-h1.md))
- Full rollout: Q3 2026
